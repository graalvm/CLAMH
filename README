What is CLAMH?
=============

CLAMH is

1.  A language-independent test harness design

2.  The implementation of that design for different languages.

The CLAMH design closely follows the design of JMH, the preeminent test harness
for Java. Since the Java Micro-benchmark Harness (JMH) already achieves the
goals of CLAMH for the Java language, the benchmark executables generated by CLAMH
for other languages are designed to be directly comparable to JMH benchmarks for
Java.
