What is LATH?
=============

LATH is

1.  A language-independent test harness design

2.  The implementation of that design for different languages.

The LATH design closely follows the design of JMH, the preeminent test harness
for Java. Since the Java Micro-benchmark Harness (JMH) already achieves the
goals of LATH for the Java language, the benchmark executables generated by LATH
for other languages are designed to be directly comparable to JMH benchmarks for
Java.
