What is CLAMH?
=============

CLAMH is

1.  A language-independent benchmark harness design

2.  The implementation of that design for different languages.

The CLAMH design closely follows the design of JMH, the preeminent benchmark harness
for Java. Since the Java Micro-benchmark Harness (JMH) already achieves the goals of
CLAMH for the Java language, the runnable benchmark files generated by CLAMH for
other languages are designed to be directly comparable to JMH benchmarks for Java.
