So, for now, to use the benchmark harness:


1. Build the parser by running "make". [You only have to do this once]


[[[ Note: you can follow steps 2 and 3 to generate and build the benchmark harness   ]]]
[[[ "by hand". Or, you can use the convenient build script "clamh_build_cpp.sh" that ]]]
[[[ can be found in clamh/scripts/ (source clamh.rc to add this to your path).       ]]]


2. You can run the parser "by hand" as follows:
   ./cpp_parser <your_benchmark_file>  >  <generated_file_name>

   For example, with the included example benchmark, "factorial_test3.cpp":
   ./cpp_parser factorial_test3.cpp > run_factorial_test3.cpp

3. Build the generated test code:
   g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -o <binary_file_name> <generated_file_name>

   For example,
   g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -o run_factorial_test3 run_factorial_test3.cpp

4. Run the test code that you just built:
   ./<binary_file_name> > <results_file_name>

   For example,
   ./run_factorial_test3 > fac_test3.result


Command-line options for the generated binary:
Enter "<binary_file_name> -h" on the command line to get a list of the available
command line options.
