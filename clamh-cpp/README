Currently, the test harness doesn't yet have the nice scripts that will make things easy.
So, for now, to use the test harness:


1. Build the parser by running "make". [You only have to do this once]

2. Run the parser by executing:
   ./cpp_parser <your_benchmark_file>  >  <generated_file_name>

   For example, with the included example benchmark, "factorial_test3.cpp":
   ./cpp_parser factorial_test3.cpp > gen_factorial_test3.cpp

3. Build the generated test code:
   g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -o <executable_name> <generated_file_name>

   For example,
   g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -o gen_factorial_test3 gen_factorial_test3.cpp

4. Run the test code that you just built:
   ./<executable_name> > <results_file_name>

   For example,
   ./gen_factorial_test3 > fac_test3.result


Command-line options for the generated executable:
-trendfile <file_name>
    Specifies the name of the file to which the CPU speed and warmup trend data will be printed.
    If '-' is specified instead of a file name, the trend data will be printed to stdout.
    If not specified, no trend data will be printed.
