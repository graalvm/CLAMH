<div2 id="intro-background"> <head>Background</head> 
<p>Forms are an important part of the Web, and they continue to be the
      primary means of interactivity used by many Web sites. Web applications and
      eCommerce solutions have sparked the demand for better Web forms with richer
      interactions. XForms are the response to this demand--extended analysis,
      followed by the creation of a new platform-independent markup language for
      online interaction between an <termref def="def-XForms-Processor">XForms Processor</termref> and
      a remote entity. XForms are the successor to XHTML forms, and benefit from the
      lessons learned in the years of HTML forms implementation experience.</p>
    <p>Further background information on XForms can be found at 
      <loc href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms</loc>.</p>

    <head>Reading the Specification</head>
    <p>This specification has been written with various types of readers in
      mind--in particular XForms authors and XForms implementors. We hope the
      specification will provide authors with the tools they need to write efficient,
      attractive, and accessible documents, without overexposing them to the XForms
      implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all they need to
      build conforming XForms Processors. The specification begins with a general
      presentation of XForms and becomes more and more technical and specific towards
      the end. For quick access to information, a general table of contents, specific
      tables of contents at the beginning of each section, and an index provide easy
      navigation, in both the electronic and printed versions.</p>
    <p>The specification has been written with two modes of presentation in
      mind: electronic and printed. In case of a discrepancy, the electronic version
      is considered the authoritative version of the document.</p>

    <head>How the Specification is Organized</head>
    <p>The specification is organized into the following chapters:</p>
    <glist>
      <gitem>
        <label>Chapters 1 and 2</label>
        <def>
          <p>An introduction to XForms The introduction includes a brief
            tutorial on XForms and a discussion of design principles behind XForms.</p>
        </def>
      </gitem>
      <gitem>
        <label>Chapters 3 and up</label>
        <def>
          <p>XForms reference manual. The bulk of the reference manual consists
            of the specification of XForms. This reference defines what may go into XForms
            and how XForms Processors must interpret the various components in order to
            claim conformance.</p>
        </def>
      </gitem>
      <gitem>
        <label>Appendixes</label>
        <def>
          <p>Appendixes contain a normative description of XForms described in
            XML Schema, information on optional function libraries, references, a change
            history, and other useful information.</p>
        </def>
      </gitem>
    </glist>

    <head>Documentation Conventions</head>
    <p>The following highlighting and typography is used to present technical
      material in this document and other documents from the XForms Working
      Group:</p>
      
    <p>Special terms are defined in their own chapter; hyperlinks connect uses
      of the term to the definition.</p>
      
    <p>Throughout this document, the namespace prefixes "<code>xform:</code>",
      "<code>xsd:</code>", and "<code>xsi:</code>" are used to denote the XForms, 
      XML Schema, and XML Schema for Instances namespaces
      respectively. This is by convention only; any namespace prefix may be used in
      practice.</p>
      
    <p>Official terms are defined in the following manner: <termdef id="def-term" term="term">
    You can find most <term>terms</term> in the chapter <specref ref="terms"/></termdef>.
    Links to <termref def="def-term">term</termref>s may be specially highlighted in the text.</p>
<!--    
    <p>BNF grammar productions are presented as follows:</p>
    <scrap>
      <head>Example</head>
      <prod id="example1">
        <lhs>name1</lhs>
        <rhs>BNF Grammar 1</rhs>

        <rhs>BNF Grammar 2</rhs>
      </prod>
    </scrap>
-->    
    <p>The XML representations of various elements within XForms are presented
  as follows: Listed are the element name, names of all attributes, allowed
  values of attributes appearing after a "=" character, default values of
  attributes appearing after a ":" character, and allowed content. One or
  more headings below the table provide additional explanatory information.</p>
  <example><head role="syntax">XML Syntax Representation &lt;<el>example</el>&gt;</head><eg><![CDATA[<example
  count = integer
  size = (small | medium | large) : medium

    this attribute</sitem>
  </slist></example>  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Non-normative short examples are set off typographically:</p>
    <slist><sitem>Example Item</sitem></slist><p>or</p><eg role="foo">Example Item</eg>
