    <head>Conditional Constructs For Dynamic User Interfaces</head>
    
    <p>
      The XForms User Interface allows the authoring of
      dynamic user interfaces, i.e., user interfaces that
      vary based on the current state of the
      instance data being populated. As an example,
      portions of a questionnaire pertaining to the user's
      automobile may become <emph>relevant</emph> only if
      the user has answered in the affirmative to the
      question 'Do you own a car?'.  Another
      use case for such dynamic user interfaces
      is when the underlying <termref def="def-XForms-Model">XForms Model</termref> contains
      conditional structures.</p>

      </ednote>
      <p>
        This element contains one or more
        <el>case</el> elements.  Each
        <el>case</el> has an <code>id</code> attribute
        that is used within event handlers appearing
        within the form controls to activate or deactivate
        that  portion of the user interface created by the markup
        contained within that <el>case</el> element.  
      </p>

      <p>The above will result in the portion of the user interface
        contained within the <emph>default case</emph> being
        initially displayed.
        Next, we define an XForms event handler <el>toggle</el>  below for
        activating and deactivating different portions of this
        conditional construct.</p>

    <head>Repeating Structures</head>
    
    <p>
      The XForms Model allows the definition of repeating
      structures such as multiple items being purchased
      within a purchase order.  When defining the XForms Model, such higher-level aggregations are constructed
      out of basic building blocks; similarly, here we
      define higher-level user interface constructs that
      build on the form controls defined previously, that can bind to
      data structures such as lists and collections.</p>

    <div3 id="ui-repeat-design">
      <head>Design Rationale</head>
      
      <p>
        The basic XForms form controls defined so far
        permit populating data instances  conforming to
        Schema simpleTypes.
        These form controls can be aggregated using
        <el>group</el>(see <specref ref="ui-layout"/>)  to form higher-level user
        interface form controls. As an extension to this, the user interface markup for
        repeating structures only adds encapsulation  metadata 
        about the collection being populated, as well as the
        necessary controls needed for adding, deleting and
        navigating the items in the repeating structure.
        Finally, this section also defines relevant portions of the
        processing model that track the item that is
        <emph>current</emph> in a repeat structure..</p>


      
      <p> Element <el>repeat</el> encapsulates the following
        pieces of metadata:</p>

      <ulist>
        <item>
          <p><emph>
              Binding expression</emph> specifying the collection to be
            populated by the contained XForms form
            controls. 
            This binding expression returns a <emph>node-set</emph> that
            represents the collection of items over which
            this <el>repeat</el> will iterate.</p>
          <issue id="nodeset-vs-ref"><p>Question: should we call this binding
              attribute <code>node-set</code> as opposed to
              <code>ref</code> to highlight that we
              use the returned node-set rather than the
              single desired node as in most other usages of the <att>ref</att> attribute? Note that submit and reset also use full node-set processing.</p></issue>

      <head>Special Event Handlers For  Element <el>repeat</el></head>

      <p>
        We define  XForms-specific event handlers for
        use within element <el>repeat</el>.
        These event handlers will appear within element
        <el>onevent</el> to specify the event handler to
        trigger when an event is received by the containing
        event listener.
        In the examples below, we will assume event
        <code>dom-click</code>;
        however, note that this specification does not normatively
        define the mapping between  physical events 
        and specific behaviors.</p>

      <p>
        Construct <el>repeat</el> introduces the notion of a
        <emph>cursor</emph> that is maintained by
        the XForms processing model for each repeating structure.
        Thus, each <el>repeat</el> has its own 
        a conceptual <emph>cursor</emph>.
        Event handlers are provided for querying and updating  the
        position of this cursor;
        this cursor position in turn is used for determining the
        behavior of <el>insert</el> and <el>delete</el>.
        Thus, these event handlers can be thought of as the markup
        equivalent of the additions to the XForms DOM
        introduced by construct <el>repeat</el>.

        element <el>group</el> and CSS layout, this allows

        delete.

      <p>
        Element <el>repeat</el> represents a repeating homogenous
        collection, in other words, a collection consisting
        entirely of like form controls.</p>

  <caption>Shopping Cart</caption>

  <!-- controls for adding, deleting and navigating entries -->
</repeat>]]></eg>

      
      <p>Notice that the underlying schema for the
        collection being populated would typically have defined
        attributes <att>minOccurs</att> and
        <att>maxOccurs</att>; these values will in
        turn determine if the user agent displays
        appropriate UI controls for the user to add or
        delete entries in the collection.  Event listeners 
        within element <el>repeat</el> control UI
        aspects such as scrolling and insertion. This
        specification will not specify normative means for
        displaying such add and delete controls; as with the

      <p>
        This subsection enumerates the design consequences
        and is for members of the Working Group to evaluate
        the above design.</p>

      <ulist>
        <item>
          <p>
            Binding expression is placed on element
            <el>repeat</el> and should refer to the
            collection being populated, not to an
            individual item of the collection. Thus, it
            would be   <el>items/item</el> in  a
            purchase order, where element <el>items</el>
            contains one or more <el>item</el>
            children.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>
            The form controls appearing inside
            element <el>repeat</el> needs to be suitable for
            populating individual items of the collection.
            Thus, to continue the purchase order example,
            the contained XForms form controls
            would need to be suitable for populating a data
            instance conforming to <el>item</el>.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>
            A simple but powerful consequence of the above
            is that if the XForms Model specifies nested
            collections, then we can create a corresponding
            user interface by <emph>nesting</emph>
            <el>repeat</el> elements.  As an example,
            consider the XForms Model  for a hypothetical
            purchase order that contains element
            <el>items</el> for holding collection of
            <el>item</el> elements. Further, assume that
            element <el>item</el> comprises of two atomic
            fields <el>catalogNumber</el>,
            <el>partNumber</el> and a collection
            <el>colors</el> which in turn holds one or more
            <el>color</el> elements.  The user interface for
            populating this data instance would use nested
            <el>repeat</el> elements.</p> </item> <item>
          <p>
            Notice that the
            contained XForms form controls inside
            element <el>repeat</el> do not explicitly
            specify the index of the collection entry being
            populated. This is intentional; it keeps both
            authoring as well as the processing model
            simple.  But as a consequence, the user
            interface cannot bind to an element from the
            underlying collection <emph>out of
              sequence</emph>.  Notice that this is not a
            serious drawback because the use interface layer
            can always populate a specific member of a
            collection without using element
            <el>repeat</el>.</p>

      <head>Creating User Interface Templates</head>
      
      <p>
        <emph>User Interface templates</emph> allow the creation of
        reusable user interface components.  Just as we can
        define data types and structures that can be reused
        within the XForms Model,
        reusable user interface components allow us to
        design complex user interfaces using the basic
        building blocks described in the previous section, and then reuse
        these components in multiple situations. As with any
        component framework, this has two basic
        requirements:</p>

      <ulist>
        <item>
          <p>
            Components need to declare what aspects of the component are parameterizable 
            by the caller.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>
            The caller needs to be able to override the default values of the parameters 
            declared in the component.</p>
        </item>
      </ulist>
      
      <p>
        Here, we describe such a component framework along with sample markup. For 
        this example, assume that <code>USShippingAddress</code> is a reusable data 
        type that is used in multiple places in the <termref def="def-XForms-Model">XForms Model</termref>, e.g. the user will 
        be asked for a <code>billingAddress</code> and <code>shippingAddress</code>--both 
        of type <code>USShippingAddress</code>.</p>

      
      <p>
        First, we show a simple example that is designed to bind an XForms <termref def="def-form-control">form 
        control</termref> to a <termref def="def-model-item">model item</termref> of 
        type <code>address</code> with no attention to making the component 
        reusable.</p>

      
      <eg xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<group>
  <textbox ref="address/street">
    <caption>Please enter your street address</caption>
  </textbox>
  <textbox ref="address/zip">
    <caption>Zip Code</caption>
  </textbox>
</group>]]></eg>

      
      <p>
        Next, we prepare the above 
        fragment to become a reusable component

    <head>Layout in XForms</head>
    
    
    <p>
      The <el>group</el> element is used as a container
      for defining a hierarchy of form controls.  Groups lay
      out their children using a constraint-based system
      that supports both relative flexible sizing and
      intrinsic sizing.  Groups can be nested to create
      complex hierarchies. Using CSS, an inline box can be
      specified using the <code>display</code> property with
      a value of <code>inline</code>.  A block-level group can
      be specified with a value of <code>block</code>, which
      is the default.</p>

    <example role="syntax"><head>XML Representation: &lt;<el>group</el>&gt;</head>
      <eg>&lt;group&gt;
  &lt;!-- all form controls &amp; mixed content --&gt;
&lt;/group&gt;</eg>
      
    </example>

    <p>
      All form
      controls defined so far are treated as
      inline text for purposes of XHTML processing.
      XForms visual clients are expected to use   a  a box layout model as defined by CSS for
      determining the overall layout of the XForms visual
      interface. Grouping of form controls using
      element <el>group</el>
      also provides semantics about the relationship amongst user
      interface controls; such knowledge can be useful in
      delivering a coherent UI to small devices--e.g.,
      if the user interface needs to be split up amongst several
      screens,  controls appearing inside the
      same
      group would typically be rendered on the same screen.</p>

    
    <p>
      Finally, the hierarchy defined by nested group elements is used to determine the 
      traversal order specified by attribute <att>navindex</att> on form controls. 
      Setting the input focus on a  group results in the focus being set to the 
      lowest form control in the tabbing order within that
      group.</p>

    <issue id="group-binding"><p>t is an open issue whether the <termref def="def-binding">binding</termref> attribute <att>xform</att> 
        is allowed on element <el>group</el>.
        It might make authoring easier but makes
        implementations significantly harder.
        Note that this note is here because at one point in our
        design we said that controls inside a
        <el>group</el>
        could use relative XPath expressions with the context being
        set by the containing group. </p></issue>
    <div3 id="ui-layout-dir">
      <head>Orientation and Direction</head>
      
      <p>
        Containers typically have an orientation and a direction.
        The <code>box-orient</code> CSS property specifies
        the orientation of the group.  It has values of
        <code>horizontal</code>, <code>vertical</code>, or
        <code>inherit</code>.  A horizontal group lays out its
        children in a horizontal line, and a vertical group
        stacks its children vertically.
      </p>

      
      <p>
        The <code>box-direction</code>
        CSS property specifies the direction of the group.  It has values of
        <code>normal</code>, <code>reverse</code>, and <code>inherit</code>.  
        A normal horizontal group lays out its children from left to right, and a normal
        vertical group lays out its children from top to bottom.  
      </p>

      
      <p>
        Direction within nested groups is inherited by
        default.  If direction is omitted on the outermost
        group, it is assumed to have a
        horizontal orientation and normal direction.
      </p>

      <!-- example goes here. -->
      
      <eg xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<group>
  <textbox  ref="/person/name">
    <caption>Please enter your name</caption>
  </textbox>
  <textbox ref="/person/ssid">
    <caption>Enter your SSID</caption>
  </textbox>
</group>]]></eg>

      
      <p>
        When items are placed in a group without specifying any additional 
        information about their size, then the  sizes the children 
        <emph>intrinsically</emph>. In other words, the group makes each child only as big
        as it needs to be. Notice that in 
        the above example, the two form controls are only as
        big as they need to be, and that this in turn
        determines the size of the group (since we assume for
        simplicity that this group is not nested).</p>

      
      <p>
        Widths can be specified for items inside a horizontal group. When an 
        object specifies its width in CSS, it is telling the group that 
        it would like to be that width. Similarly, heights can be specified in CSS
        for items in a vertical group. 
        A non-nested group placed inside an enclosing CSS block will obey
        all the usual sizing rules of the block.  For example, setting the width of
        a non-nested group to 100% ensures that the group is the maximum width permitted by 
        the enclosing CSS block.
      </p>

    </div3>
    <div3 id="ui-layout-align">
      <head>Alignment</head>
      
      <p>
        The <code>box-align</code> property specifies how controls are aligned along the orientation
        of the group.  Its possible values are <code>left</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>right</code>, 
        <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>baseline</code>, <code>stretch</code> and <code>inherit</code>.  
        The default value is <code>stretch</code>.
      </p>

      
      <p>
        By default a horizontal group ensures that all children are the same height.  Once a height
        is computed for a horizontal group, all of the children are stretched vertically to the
        height of the group (minus the CSS border and padding on the group).  
        Similarly, a vertical group ensures that all its children are
        the same width.  The stretch policy overrides any
        specified width or height values.</p>

      
      <eg xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<group style="box-orient: vertical">
  <output ref="/person/name"/>
  <output ref="/person/age"/>
  <output ref="/person/country"/>
</group>]]></eg>

      
      <p>
        In addition to <code>stretch</code>, a horizontal group can also align its children using the 
        values <code>top</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>baseline</code> and <code>bottom</code>.  A vertical
        group can align its children using the values <code>left</code>, <code>center</code>, and <code>right</code>.
        When these values are used, the items are no longer stretched.  They are sized intrinsically
        and then aligned on the group axis according to the specified property value on the containing
        group.</p>

    </div3>
    <div3 id="ui-layout-sizing">
      <head>Controlling  Automatic Sizing </head>
      
      <p>
        The layout algorithm can be controlled by specifying the
        degree to which items may <emph>flex</emph> i.e.,
        the degree to which an item allows itself to be
        <emph>auto-sized</emph>.
        Items in groupes fall into two categories: <code>flexible</code> and 
        <code>inflexible</code>. Inflexible objects will not grow, even when there is 
        extra space left over in the group.
        When several objects in a group are flexible, the extra space is divided 
        among the objects based on how flexible they are. The group determines how 
        much space to give an object by adding up the flex values on all of its 
        children. An object gets an amount of extra space equal to the percentage 
        of flex that it is responsible for.</p>

      
      <p>
        For example, if two objects have a flex of 1, then after both objects 
        are given their preferred sizes, the first object 
        gets 1/(1+1) = 1/2 of the extra space, and the second object also gets 1/2 
        of the extra space.</p>

      <!-- create example 4 here -->
      
      <eg xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<group style="box-orient: horizontal; width: 200px">
  <textbox  style="box-flex: 1"  ref="/person/name>
    <caption>Please enter your full name: </caption>
  </textbox>
  <textbox  style="box-flex: 1.5" ref="/person/age>
    <caption>How young?</caption>
  </textbox>
</group>]]></eg>

    </div3>
    <div3 id="ui-layout-minmax">
      <head>Preferred, Minimum, and Maximum Sizes</head>
      
      <p>
        For inflexible objects, the specification of the <code>width</code>
        and <code>height</code> CSS properties can be used to 
        specify a preferred  size. If these properties are omitted, 
        an inflexible object will be sized intrinsically, i.e., it will be given
        the minimum amount of space required to lay out the item.</p>

      
      <p>
        With flexible objects, there are more options. Just as with inflexible 
        objects, the <code>width</code>
        and <code>height</code> properties can be used to specify a preferred 
        size. Unlike inflexible objects, however, this size is only a guideline. 
        A flexible object will stretch as necessary. It will also 
        shrink if required until it can shrink no more (e.g., 
        when the object hits its minimum required intrinsic size).</p>

      
      <eg xml:space="preserve"> <![CDATA[<group style="box-orient: vertical">
  <textbox style="box-flex: 1; height:1000px" ref="/person/name">
    <caption>Please enter your name:</caption>
  </textbox>
</group>]]></eg>

      
      <p>
        In the above example if the group were to shrink, the
        textbox being flexible would shrink--despite its
        preferred height of <code>1000px</code>.  The group
        continues to shrink minimum required height for the
        textbox is reached. After that, the textbox can
        shrink no further. If the group were to continue to
        shrink, the form control's contents would be
        clipped, and a portion of the control would no
        longer be visible.</p>

      
      <p>
        For a more fine-grained control of
        minimum and maximum sizes, the
        <code>min-width</code>, <code>min-height</code>,
        <code>max-width</code>, and <code>max-height</code>
        CSS properties can be used. When specified, these
        properties provide extra information to the group as
        it shrinks and grows the object in question.</p>

      
      <p>
        In a horizontal group, for example, if a minimum
        width is specified, then the flexible object will
        not be allowed to shrink below that width. If a
        maximum width is specified, then the flexible object
        will not be allowed to grow beyond that width.</p>

      
      <p>
        The above example demonstrates the use of <code>min-height</code> and <code>max-height</code>
        within a vertical group. In the first 
        image the group has been shrunk until it is smaller than 100 pixels in 
        height. Because the <el>iframe</el> has a specified minimum height of 100 pixels, 
        it is not allowed to shrink any further, and so as the group falls below 100 
        pixels, the <el>iframe</el> gets clipped, and portions of it become invisible.</p>

      
      <p>
        In the second image, the group has been expanded past 300 pixels in 
        height. Even though the group is getting bigger, the extra space is not 
        being consumed by the <el>iframe</el>, because its maximum height of 300 pixels has 
        been reached. It will grow no further.</p>

      
      <p>
        Below is another example illustrating min and max width.</p>
      
      <eg>Example unavailable at publication time</eg>

      <p>
        In the above example, the group has been stretched so that it is very 
        wide. The first child has a maximum width of 50 pixels, and it divides the 
        excess space equally with the second child until its maximum width has 
        been reached. After that, since it is not allowed to grow any further, the 
        remaining space all goes to the second child.</p>

    </div3>
    <div3 id="ui-layout-packing">
      <head>Packing Controls</head> 
      
      <p>
        When all of the items within a <el>group</el>
        element are inflexible or when all objects have
        grown to their maximum sizes and can stretch no
        further, extra space may be left over in the group.
        An additional property can be used to dictate how
        any additional space should be distributed between
        objects.  The CSS property <code>box-pack</code> has
        the possible values of <code>left</code>,
        <code>right</code>, <code>top</code>,
        <code>bottom</code>, <code>center</code>,
        <code>justify</code> and <code>inherit</code>.  The
        default is <code>justify</code>.</p>

      
      <p>
        In the above example, the button is centered within the group using the <code>box-align</code>
        and <code>box-pack</code> properties together.  The former centers the button vertically, and
        the latter centers the button horizontally.</p>

    </div3>
    <div3 id="ui-layout-overflow">
      <head>Overflow</head>
      
      <p>
        Items within a group may use the CSS <code>overflow</code> property to obtain horizontal and
        vertical scrollbars as needed.  Flexible objects that shrink below their minimum intrinsic
        size (but that still have a size greater than a specified CSS minimum) can display 
        scrollbars using the <code>overflow</code> property.  If overflow is not specified,
        the object will be clipped instead.</p>

    </div3>
    <div3 id="ui-layout-inline">
      <head>Inlines and Blocks</head>
      
      <p>
        Whether an element is inline or block when placed directly inside a group is irrelevant.  Objects
        will be flowed horizontally or vertically based off the
        <code>box-orient</code> property.
      </p>

      
      <p>
        When any raw text nodes are encountered directly inside a group, an anonymous block is constructed
        to wrap the text.  This anonymous block then participates in the  layout as
        a single item.</p>

  </div2><div2 id="ui-subforms">
    <head>Multiple Sub-forms Or Sub-pages</head>
    <ednote>
      <name>Raman</name> <date>March 12, 2001</date>
      <edtext>Notice that we originally started by creating
        an equivalent of <code>fieldset</code>--but given
        the present design of the XForms UI layer, and given
        that conditional construct <el>case</el> can take
        either <code>group</code> or <el>html:div</el> elements,
        there is little left in this construct that is
        additional to what is in XHTML <el>html:div</el>.  I
        therefore suggest simply reusing <el>html:div</el>--perhaps
        bind XForms specific behaviors through CSS
        e.g., a stack of cards for example?  The way I am
        thinking of this is that whether it is a stack of
        cards shown one at a time, or a sequence of tab
        dialogs is a presentation issue and might therefore be
        best left to CSS as we have done with the rest of the
        presentational issues in XForms.</edtext>
    </ednote>
    <div3 id="ui-subforms-pages">
      <head>Subpages</head>
      
      <p>
        Subpages provide a means to present XForms one bit at a time, breaking a complex 
        task into smaller, simpler parts. Presentation of a subpage can occupy the entire 
        "page" or just part of a page. Different presentations are possible, e.g. a 
        stack of <emph>pages</emph> with visible name tags, or as a set of buttons for flipping 
        through the stack or navigating directly to a particular subpage. One possible 
        representation is a <el>formset</el> element enclosing one or more <el>subpage</el> 
        elements, each of which starts with a
        <el>caption</el> element. </p>

      
      <p>
        As the name implies <el>subpage</el> is not specific to XForms--our intent 
        is to design <el>subpage</el> so that it can be used within XForms--and 
        more generally within XHTML to create presentations where document views are 
        presented to progressively reveal the document
        structure and content.</p>
