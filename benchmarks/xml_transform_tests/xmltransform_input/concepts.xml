<p>This informative chapter provides an easily approachable description of the design
  of XForms, describing the major components and how they relate. Not every feature of
  XForms is covered here. For a complete, normative description of XForms, refer to the
  remainder of this document.</p> 
  <div2 id="concepts-purpose-presentation"><head>Purpose and Presentation</head>
  <p>For explanatory purposes, a form can be considered to consist of 'purpose', 'presentation',
  and 'data'. Some examples:</p>
  <table width="100%"><thead><tr><td><term>Purpose</term></td><td><term>Presentation</term></td><td><term>Data</term></td></tr>
  </thead><tbody>
  <tr><td>Data collection</td><td>Arrangement of form controls</td><td>Registration information</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Time card</td><td>How dates are entered</td><td>Days and hours worked</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Order form</td><td>How to render the form controls on small devices</td><td>Order, shipping, and payment info</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Information Please</td><td>How the form integrates with a Web site</td><td>User contact information</td></tr>
  </tbody></table>
  
  <p>The design of existing Web forms didn't separate the purpose from the presentation
  of a form, and additionally offered only a restricted representation for data captured through the form. This is the primary difference between XForms and previous form technologies.</p></div2><div2 id="concepts-xhtml"> 
    <head> Current Approach: XHTML</head> 
  <p> Take for instance a simple eCommerce form authored in XHTML 1.0:</p>
  <eg><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN"
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en">
<body>
<form action="http://example.com/submit" method="post">
  <span>Select Payment Method: </span>
  <input type="radio" name="paytype" value="cash">Cash</input>
  <input type="radio" name="paytype" value="credit">Credit</input><br/>
  <label>Credit Card Number: <input type="text" name="cc"/></label><br/>
  <label>Expiration Date: <input type="text" name="exp"/></label><br/>
  <input type="submit"/>
</form>
</body>
</html>]]></eg><p>A browser might render this form as follows:</p>
<graphic source="images/concepts-xhtml.png" alt="screen shot of a graphic rendering"/>
<p>This form makes no effort to separate purpose (data collection semantics) from  presentation (the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> form controls), and offers no
control over the basic name/value formatting of the resulting data. XForms greatly
improves the expressive capabilities of electronic forms.</p>
</div2>
<div2 id="concepts-xfu"><head>Stepping Up to XForms</head>
<p>XForms are comprised of separate sections that describe what the form does, and how
the form is to be presented. This allows for flexible presentation options, making it possible for classic XHTML
form controls, as well as other form control sets such as WML to be leveraged, as
shown here.</p>
<graphic source="images/arch1.jpg" alt="puzzle pieces; 'XForm Model' on the left, on the right 'XForms User Interface', 'XHTML', 'WML', and a stack of 'proprietary' pieces"/>
<p>The simplest case involves authoring only the new XForms
<termref def="def-form-control">form control</termref>s, leaving out the other sections of the form. To convert the previous form into
XForms this way, an <el>xform</el> element is needed in the <el>head</el> section of
the document:</p>
<eg><![CDATA[<xform:xform>
  <xform:submitInfo target="http://example.com/submit" method="..."/>
</xform:xform>]]></eg>
<p>With these changes to the containing document, the previous example could be rewritten
like this:</p>
<eg><![CDATA[<selectOne xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/06/xforms" ref="paytype">
  <caption>Select Payment Method</caption>
  <choices>
    <item value="cash">Cash</item>
    <item value="credit">Credit</item>
  </choices>
</selectOne>
<textbox xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/06/xforms" ref="cc">
  <caption>Credit Card Number</caption>
</textbox>
<textbox xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/06/xforms" ref="exp">
  <caption>Expiration Date</caption>
</textbox>
<submit xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/06/xforms"/>]]></eg>
<p>Notice the following features of this design:</p>
<ulist><item><p>The user interface is not hard-coded to use radio buttons. Different devices
  (such as a voice browser) can render the concept of "selectOne" as appropriate.</p></item>
<item><p>Form controls always have captions directly associated with them, as child elements.</p></item>
<item><p>There is no need for an enclosing <el>form</el> element.</p></item>
<item><p>Element names for form controls have been changed: <el>textbox</el> is a specific
element, rather than a <att>type</att> attribute on <el>input</el>, as in XHTML.</p> </item>
<item><p>Data entered through the form controls ends up submitted as XML.</p></item>
</ulist>
<p>With these changes, the <termref def="def-XForms-Processor">XForms Processor</termref>
will be able to directly submit XML instance data. The XML is constructed by creating a root
element with child elements reflecting the names given to each form control.  For instance,
the submitted data might look like this:</p>
<eg><![CDATA[<!-- envelope, generated separately -->
<Envelope>
  <Body>]]></eg><eg><![CDATA[    <!-- serialized instance data -->
    <paytype>Credit</paytype>
    <cc>12354677890123456</cc>
    <exp>04-2001</exp>]]></eg>
<eg><![CDATA[  <!-- envelope, generated separately -->
  </Body>
</Envelope>]]></eg></div2>
<div2 id="concpts-instance"><head>Providing XML Instance Data</head>
<p>Understandably, authors will often desire greater control over exact construction of the
submitted instance data. One common case might be submitting to a server XML data that is
validated against a predefined DTD or XML Schema.</p>
<p>XForms keeps track of the state of the partially filled form through
<termref def="def-instance-data">instance data</termref>, which provides an outline
of the desired  XML data, including namespace information. The instance data starts
off with the initial values for the form, is updated as the user fills the form, and
eventually is serialized and submitted. The initial instance data is taken from the
<el>instance</el> element inside the <el>xform</el> element, defined as follows:</p>
<eg><![CDATA[<xform:xform>
  <xform:submitInfo target="http://example.com/submit" method="..."/>
  <xform:instance>
    <payment type="credit" xmlns="http://commerce.example.com/payment">
      <cc/>
      <exp/>
    </payment>
  </xform:instance>
</xform:xform>]]></eg>
<p>This design has features worth calling out:</p><ulist>
<item><p>There is complete flexibility in the structure of the XML. Notice that the item
  <code>paytype</code> is now expressed as an attribute <att>type</att> of the element
  <el>payment</el>.</p></item>
<item><p>Empty elements <el>cc</el> and <el>exp</el> serve as placeholders in the XML structure,
  and will be filled in with form data provided by the user.</p></item>
<item><p>An initial value (<code>"credit"</code>) for the form control is provided through the
  <att>type</att> attribute in the instance data. In the submitted XML, this initial value will
  be replaced by the user input, if any.</p></item>
<item><p>The instance data provides a unique namespace, which will be used when the XML gets
  submitted.</p></item></ulist>
  <p>To connect this instance data with  form controls, the
<att>ref</att> attributes on the form controls need to point to the proper part of the instance
data, using <termref def="def-binding-expression">binding expressions</termref>:</p>
<eg><![CDATA[  <selectOne ref="payment/@type">
  ...
  <inputText ref="payment/cc">
  ...
  <inputText ref="payment/exp">]]></eg>
<p>Binding expressions are based on XPath <bibref ref="ref-xpath-1.0"/>, including
  the use of the '@' character to refer to attributes, as seen here.</p>
  </div2> 
<div2 id="concepts-model"><head>The XForms Model</head>
<p>The earlier XHTML form in <specref ref="concepts-xhtml"/>. Even in this short form,
there are several aspects that would be desirable to express, but would only be possible
through the addition of unstructured script code:
</p>
<ulist><item><p>The credit card information fields <code>cc</code> and <code>exp</code> are
only relevant if the "Credit" option is chosen in the <code>paytype</code> field.</p></item>
<item><p>The credit card information fields <code>cc</code> and <code>exp</code> should be
required when the "Credit" option is chosen in the <code>paytype</code> field.</p></item>
<item><p>The field <code>cc</code> should accept digits only, and should have exactly 14,
15, or 16 digits.</p></item>
<item><p>The field <code>exp</code> should accept only valid month/date combinations.</p></item></ulist>
<p>By specifying a 3rd component, the <termref def="def-XForms-Model">XForms Model</termref>,
authors can include rich declarative datatype and validation information in forms.</p>
<ednote><name>MJD</name><edtext>The examples here are sketchy out of necessity; this section
will need to be rewritten after the Schema Basic task force delivers its syntax recommendations.</edtext></ednote>
<p>An XForms Model consists of <termref def="def-model-item">model items</termref>, which
include XML Schema datatype information <bibref ref="ref-xschema-2"/> as well as properties
specific to XForms.</p>
<eg><![CDATA[<!-- add to the cc model item the following: -->
relevant="value('payment/@type') == 'credit'"
required="true"
datatype of "xform:string"
facet pattern of "\d{14,16}"

<!-- add to the exp model item the following: -->
relevant="value('payment/@type') == 'credit'"
required="true"
datatype of "xform:gYearMonth"]]></eg>
</div2>
<div2 id="concepts-multiple"><head>Multiple Forms per Document</head>
<p>XForms places no limits on the number of individual forms that can be placed in a single
<termref def="def-containing-document">containing document</termref>. When multiple forms share
the same containing document, multiple
<el>xform</el> elements are needed. The first <el>xform</el> element may skip a unique <att>id</att>
attribute (as have all the examples above), but subsequent  <el>xform</el> elements require
an <att>id</att> so that they can be referenced from elsewhere in the containing document.</p>
<p>The other side of the equation is that form controls throughout the document need to specify
which <el>xform</el> element is associated with the instance data to which they bind. This is
accomplished through an <att>xform</att> attribute alongside the <att>ref</att> attribute. The
default for the <att>xform</att> attribute is to refer to the first <el>xform</el> element in
document order.</p><p>To add a second form, an opinion poll, to our commerce example, the
following would be authored in the head section of the XHTML:</p>
<eg><![CDATA[<xform:xform>
  <xform:submitInfo target="http://example.com/submit" method="..."/>
  <xform:instance>
     ...payment instance data...
  </xform:instance>
</xform:xform>

<xform:xform id="poll">
  <xform:submitInfo target="http://example.com/poll" method="..."/>
</xform:xform>]]></eg><p>Additionally, the following form control markup in the body:</p>
<eg><![CDATA[<selectOne ref="pollOption" xform="poll"  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/06/xforms">
  <caption>How useful is this page to you?</caption>
  <choices>
    <item value="0">Not at all helpful</item>
    <item value="1">Barely helpful</item>
    <item value="2">Somewhat helpful</item>
    <item value="3">Very helpful</item>
  </choices>
</selectOne>
<submit xform="poll"  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/06/xforms"/>]]></eg>
<p>The main difference to note here is the use of <code>xform="poll"</code>,
  which identifies which form the form control binds to.</p></div2>
<div2 id="concepts-advancedUI"><head>Additional User Interface Capabilities</head>
<p>The visual layout appearance of the initial XHTML forms such as the above example
(<specref ref="concepts-xhtml"/>) leaves much to be desired. </p>
